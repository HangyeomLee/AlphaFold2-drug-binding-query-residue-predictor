# AlphaFold2-drug-binding-query-residue-predictor-neural-network
Implemented a neural network using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Tensorflow, to predict 'drug binding' or 'non-drug binding' for any query residue on an AlphaFold2 predicted protein model. 

For those who wander:

A neural network is an approach to machine learning, inspired by neural networks in real human brains. The approach
